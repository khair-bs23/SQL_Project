1. Database and Table Creation
	-- Constraints not added properly for few columns
	-- Decimal point limit not defined in price column

2. Task 1 
	-- created actual table for US holidays, temporary table creation should be more appropriate 
	-- asked to subset the peak seasons (holiday, weekand), you deleted the data rather selecting the subset (it's scary) 

3. Task 2
	-- Stock quantity data is not present in the database. You showed the total quantity as required inventory. It's actually total 	orders count for each item. 
	
4. Task 3
	-- this question also links to the previous one requires stock data. showed the total quantity as a total inventory perfectly. 

5. Task 4
	-- suggession provided without any prior background. You should show the monthly inventory and how the sales growing for each 	product and then come up with a suggestion based on these results.
